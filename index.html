                    <h1>Nirmal Surange</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am a PhD researcher at the Language Technologies Research Center (LTRC), IIIT-Hyderabad, specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). My research focuses on NLP for Indian languages and graph-based representations of language, with an emphasis on building interpretable, linguistically grounded models through the development of semantically rich, task-oriented datasets that support robust evaluation and model design in multilingual settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In parallel with my research, I actively mentor junior researchers and contribute to open, collaborative efforts in NLP. I currently serve as a Senior Research Associate at LTRC and have previously worked as a Teaching Assistant and Course Instructor at IIIT-Hyderabad, as well as a Lecturer at NIT Raipur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My collaborative work includes the development of multilingual resources like BRIGHTER, an emotion-annotated corpus across 27 languages, and SemRel, a benchmark for semantic textual relatedness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These experiences have shaped my approach to collaborative research and reflect a sustained engagement with academic instruction and community-building. Through these initiatives, I aim to support research that is open, linguistically informed, and reflective of the diversity inherent in the languages we seek to model.
